In this project,  Clustrering algorithms performed with real-life data of Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. 
The data here concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany.Here main iterest is to identify facets of the 
population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign. Various unsupervised learning techniques such as 
clustering algorithms applied to organize the general population into clusters, then use those clusters to see which of them comprise
the main user bias.
